# Building the Interactive Aquarium

### The highs and lows of what's getting done this week and what will be done next week

This week was a real eye opener in terms of realizing the amount of work that needs to be completed within the next month. The work back schedule put into perspective all the small goals/milestones that we will need to hit in order to have a medium fidelity product and presentation ready by April 4th. Luckily our team is large and consists of another designer other than myself to better distribute the work load. 

This week we started to assign all group members work. This was a heavy week for me since we needed to have a solid chunk of the design done before the computer science members of our group can figure out how to make the fish in our interactive aquarium functionally responsive. To populate the aquarium I had 7 fish to draw, (14 fish in total so far with Britt's other 7) which means researching, sketching, and then inputting them into the computer. 

Next week from a design standpoint we have two tasks to accomplish:

- choosing a name and then creating a logo for the interactive aquarium
- creating the aquaruim atmosphere that will act as a background
